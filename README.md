Fiddly things to do when finishing a paper (and you're not using a sophisticated typesetting language)

### typography

- [ ] don't use leading zero on correlations, proportions or p-values (_p_&nbsp;=&nbsp;.051, not _p_&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.051)
- [ ] use [non-breaking spaces](http://practicaltypography.com/nonbreaking-spaces.html) 
  * Use them around `=`, `<`, etc.
  * And inside numbered/lettered things like "Experiment&nbsp;1" or "Fig.&nbsp;1"
  * CTRL SHIFT SPACE in MS Word, `&nbsp;` in HTML 
- [ ] use an en-dash (&ndash;) `&ndash;` 
  * in ranges (10–20) 
  * when writing "UW–Madison" or "University of Wisconsin–Madison"
- [ ] use a minus sign (&minus;) for negative numbers like &minus;10 `&minus;`
- [ ] use a multiplication sign (×) `&times;` for multiplication expressions, dimensions ("100 &times; 100 pixel image") and interactions ("a significant Age &times; Language interaction")

### grammar

- [ ] verbs after either/or and neither/nor agree with noun closest to verb. 
  * _Neither Kiki nor Nooper was happy with their treats_.
  * _Neither Tristan nor his cats were happy._

### word count

- [ ] if an abbreviation is in a "collegiate" dictionary as its own entry, you can assume the reader knows the abbreviation and not redefine it in-text
 * IQ, SES
